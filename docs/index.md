# Welcome to DriveAI Challenges

## Who are we?

We're [DriveAI!](http://driveai.org). We develop open source software for autonomous vehicles so anyone can build one. The sum of all our knowledge is located at our [docsite](http://docs.driveai.org). We're an open source project. So feel free to contribute to *anything!*

## What are the challenges?

The *DriveAI Challenges* are a way for anyone to learn more about algorithms and challenges that are at the forefront of the Autonomous Vehicle industry. Every month we'll post challenges that will involve solving a problem, and we'll award prizes to whoever solves them  most effectively given a criteria.

## Who can participate?

*Anyone*. We'll provide guides and learning material for anyone to solve the challenge. Whether you're just a beginner or pursuing a PHD, this will be a fun way to challenge yourself, and help the autonomous vehicle community. Your submissions will play an integral role in the creation of our vehicles. Get started with [Waldo Challenge](/waldo).
